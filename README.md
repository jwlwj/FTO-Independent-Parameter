## Background:
This respiratory illustrates the examples of my PhD research project entitled "Sensor Failure\'97Tolerant Observer Design with Regional Pole Placement," which was published in [IEEE Control Systems Letters 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9662057) and accepted for presentation at the 2022 American Control Conference.

## Examples:
1. 4th Order Nodic
2. Randomly Large Scale System

## Abstract:
The purpose of this work is to design a failure-tolerant observer that meets pole position constraints to enhance the observer's response under various sensor failure scenarios while optimizing the nominal performance, measured by a disturbance rejection metric. 

## Implementations:
- A failure-tolerant observer design methodology based on the regional pole placement (RPP) technique is provided. 
- The number of sensors $m$ and a minimum number of assumed functional sensors $p$ define the range of failure situations. 
- A semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique is presented to alleviate the computational burden imposed by a large number of evaluated failure situations. 
- Hadamard and block Hadamard product approaches are suggested to provide more degrees of freedom in searching for the optimal solution. 

## Results:
